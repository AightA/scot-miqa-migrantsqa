        Migrants' Q & A
      </Header>
      <p>
        Arriving in a new country may be an unsettling time for you and your
        family and life in a new land may be confusing. “How do I enrol my
        children in school?” “Where can I find shelter” – these are some
        examples of questions that people may ask themselves as they start to
        rebuild their life in the host country. This forum is designed by
        migrants for migrants - to help the newcomers to Glasgow with any
        questions they might have. The people answering the questions are
        migrants themselves or people who have an understanding of the issues
        people face when they resettle in Glasgow.{" "}
